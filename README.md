# **Students Mark Prediction Model**

# **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting students' marks based on various features like study hours, attendance, and other performance indicators using machine learning techniques. The primary algorithm used is Linear Regression for regression analysis

# **Requirements**
Make sure you have Python installed along with these libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
To install the libraries, run:

# **Dataset**
The dataset includes features that influence student performance, such as:

Hours studied
Attendance percentage
Participation in class
Previous academic performance



#**Key Steps**
1. Data Preprocessing

Importing and cleaning the data using pandas.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling and normalization using scikit-learn.

2. Feature Engineering
   
Generating new features based on the existing ones to improve model performance.
Extracting relevant statistics and metrics from the dataset to capture more variance.

3. Model Building: 

Linear Regression: Predicting students' marks based on the relationship between features.

4. Model Evaluation
 
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used to evaluate the regression models' accuracy.

5. Visualization
Graphs for actual vs. predicted marks using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Heatmaps for correlations between features.
